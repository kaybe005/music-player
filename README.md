* Song list display with title, artist, and duration
* Delete songs from the playlist
* Dynamically updated album art (or a default image)

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Use the controls to play, pause, skip, and shuffle through the songs.

## Technologies Used
